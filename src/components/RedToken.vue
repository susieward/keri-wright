          The Red Token Project is a charity concept to bring sanitary products to women, trans men, and non-binary people. This is a personal project of mine in its early stages, but it provided a fun and exciting design opportunity for its web presence.

                  Designing a site for a charity that is still in development presents some unique challenges. The site needs to engage the user with the possibilities of what the charity can accomplish, without the luxury of having an abundance of photos and examples.

                  Charities come in all sizes, from local efforts like Friends of Warner Parks to household names like the Red Cross. I began by exploring the sites of charities on all ends of this spectrum, but with a focus on the smaller ones.

                  The Red Token Project site is targeted to potential donors - the charity’s recipients don’t typically have internet access or a computer. Without any real advertising budget, awareness of the charity would need to be word-of-mouth or spread via social media, where attention spans are notoriously limited. Because of this, I opted for an uncluttered and immediately engaging design.

                              I chose to break up these four questions into panels, alternating between a 40/60 text/image panel, and a full width text panel. This would increase the impact of each panel while providing space for graphics, which provide a succinct visual summary of what the charity does without interfering with the eye’s natural movement through the page.

                              The wireframe largely followed the layout of my sketch, but I added some offset between the header logo and the content boxes to help the content stand out visually.

                        Since visually breaking up the content panels was important, I chose a relatively high-contrast color palette. Often, media or copy related to tampons, wipes, pads, and other hygiene products is euphemistic to the point of obscurity. Since this charity deals with a real and serious problem, our users want content and graphics that are more direct. Without the resources of a dedicated graphic designer available, I created the graphics myself to ensure they were as cohesive as possible with the overall art direction of the site.

                        An important part of this charity is hosting public events to collect donations and distribute products to the homeless. Traditional event pages use a calendar of some kind, with Red Token events expected to be large but relatively infrequent, listing every day as on a calendar would be distracting noise and could prevent a visitor from finding an event.
Instead, I opted for a list solution that displayed the nearest few upcoming events with their date and location.
